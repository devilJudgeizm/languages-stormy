      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)

      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (citizen + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (citizen) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.

  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the town hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the town hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!

	<value>You are Otto ☠️. Every night, you dig the graves for all the students who died since the last time you did (yes, even luthers deserve a proper burial). Since you are out all night, luthers and the viktor’s people can't find you, unless you actually have nothing to do (i.e. no one died), in that case you'll just stay at your home near the student’s dorm. Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you dug. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the students' team with you. But since you are out at night, the luthers or Chet Rodo might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently Chet Rodo can find you whether you're at home or not, but they might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt their leg, causing them to maybe lose control over who is their victim the next night...</value>
